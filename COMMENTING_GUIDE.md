# ShadowNews - Comprehensive File Commenting Guide
# ============================================================================
#
# Standardized documentation guidelines for the ShadowNews project.
# This guide ensures consistent, comprehensive commenting across all files
# in the codebase, improving maintainability and developer onboarding.
#
# Documentation Philosophy:
# - Every file should have a clear purpose and responsibility
# - Code should be self-documenting with meaningful names and structure
# - Comments should explain "why" not just "what"
# - JSDoc standards for JavaScript/TypeScript files
# - Comprehensive examples for common patterns
#
# Target Audience:
# - New developers joining the ShadowNews team
# - Existing team members maintaining consistency
# - External contributors understanding the codebase
# - Future developers working on platform evolution
#
# Last Updated: 2025-07-27

# ============================================================================\n\n# ShadowNews - File Commenting Guide

## File Priority for Commenting

### High Priority (Core Architecture)
1. âœ… Server entry points (server.js, app.js)
2. âœ… Configuration files (config/*.js)
3. ðŸ”„ Database models (models/*.js)
4. ðŸ”„ Core services (services/*.js)
5. ðŸ”„ API controllers (api/controller/*.js)
6. ðŸ”„ Authentication middleware
7. ðŸ”„ Main routes (api/routes/*.js)

### Medium Priority (Business Logic)
1. Workers and background jobs
2. Utility functions
3. Validation middleware
4. WebSocket handlers
5. Email templates and services

### Lower Priority (Frontend & Tests)
1. React components
2. Frontend services
3. Styling files
4. Test files
5. Configuration files (package.json, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Core (Days 1-2)
- Models and database utilities
- Core services (auth, email, repository)
- Main controllers
- Critical middleware

### Phase 2: Backend API (Days 3-4)
- All routes
- Remaining controllers
- Workers and background jobs
- Utility functions

### Phase 3: Frontend Core (Days 5-6)
- Main components
- API services
- Store/state management
- Hooks and utilities

### Phase 4: Documentation & Polish (Day 7)
- Configuration files
- Test files
- Docker and deployment files
- README updates

## Automation Script Ideas

You could create a script to:
1. Scan all files and identify which ones lack proper comments
2. Generate basic comment templates based on file type
3. Insert standard headers automatically
4. Flag complex functions that need detailed documentation

This systematic approach ensures consistent, comprehensive documentation across your entire codebase!

/**
 * Nodemon Development Server Configuration Documentation
 * 
 * Comprehensive documentation for nodemon.json configuration file used in
 * the ShadowNews backend development environment. Explains all configuration
 * options and their impact on development workflow and server behavior.
 * 
 * Configuration Overview:
 * The nodemon.json file configures the nodemon development server monitoring
 * and automatic restart functionality. It optimizes the development workflow
 * by providing intelligent file watching, selective restart triggers, and
 * environment-specific configuration for efficient development cycles.
 * 
 * Configuration Features:
 * - File Watching: Monitors source code changes for automatic restart
 * - Extension Filtering: Watches specific file types for relevant changes
 * - Ignore Patterns: Excludes test files and build artifacts from monitoring
 * - Environment Setup: Development-specific environment configuration
 * - Performance Tuning: Optimized restart timing and legacy compatibility
 * 
 * Development Workflow Benefits:
 * - Automatic Restart: Server restarts on source code changes
 * - Fast Feedback: Immediate reflection of code changes in running server
 * - Test Isolation: Test files excluded from triggering restarts
 * - Build Optimization: Only relevant files trigger restart cycles
 * - Legacy Support: Compatible with older file system watching mechanisms
 * 
 * Configuration Options Explained:
 * 
 * 1. "watch" Array:
 *    - Purpose: Specifies directories to monitor for file changes
 *    - Value: ["src"]
 *    - Rationale: Focuses monitoring on source code directory only
 *    - Benefits: Avoids unnecessary restarts from documentation or config changes
 * 
 * 2. "ext" String:
 *    - Purpose: Defines file extensions to monitor for changes
 *    - Value: "js,json"
 *    - Rationale: JavaScript and JSON files contain application logic
 *    - Benefits: Ignores irrelevant file types like .md, .txt, .log files
 * 
 * 3. "ignore" Array:
 *    - Purpose: Specifies files and patterns to exclude from monitoring
 *    - Values: ["src/**\/*.test.js", "src/tests/**\/*"]
 *    - Rationale: Test files shouldn't trigger production server restarts
 *    - Benefits: Maintains server stability during test development
 * 
 * 4. "exec" String:
 *    - Purpose: Defines command to execute when starting/restarting server
 *    - Value: "node src/server.js"
 *    - Rationale: Points to main server entry point
 *    - Benefits: Consistent startup behavior across restarts
 * 
 * 5. "env" Object:
 *    - Purpose: Sets environment variables for server execution
 *    - Value: {"NODE_ENV": "development"}
 *    - Rationale: Enables development-specific features and debugging
 *    - Benefits: Proper environment configuration for development mode
 * 
 * 6. "legacyWatch" Boolean:
 *    - Purpose: Enables legacy file watching mechanism
 *    - Value: true
 *    - Rationale: Better compatibility with different file systems
 *    - Benefits: Improved reliability on systems with watching limitations
 * 
 * 7. "delay" String:
 *    - Purpose: Specifies delay before restarting after file changes
 *    - Value: "2500" (milliseconds)
 *    - Rationale: Prevents excessive restarts during rapid file modifications
 *    - Benefits: Allows file operations to complete before restart
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - Selective Monitoring: Only src/ directory monitored for efficiency
 * - File Type Filtering: Only .js and .json files trigger restarts
 * - Test File Exclusion: Test changes don't interrupt server operation
 * - Restart Throttling: 2.5-second delay prevents restart storms
 * - Memory Optimization: Legacy watch mode for better memory usage
 * 
 * Development Best Practices:
 * - Keep configuration minimal and focused on source code changes
 * - Exclude test files to maintain separation of concerns
 * - Use appropriate delay to balance responsiveness and stability
 * - Enable legacy watch for better cross-platform compatibility
 * - Set development environment variables for proper debugging
 * 
 * Troubleshooting:
 * - If file changes aren't detected, check if files are in "watch" directories
 * - If too many restarts occur, increase "delay" value
 * - If watching fails on your system, ensure "legacyWatch" is enabled
 * - If wrong environment is detected, verify "env.NODE_ENV" setting
 * 
 * Integration with Development Workflow:
 * - Start development server: npm run dev (uses nodemon)
 * - File changes automatically trigger server restart
 * - Console output shows restart reason and timing
 * - Development environment features are automatically enabled
 * - Test files can be modified without affecting running server
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - nodemon package for file monitoring and server restart functionality
 * - Node.js runtime for server execution and process management
 * - File system watching capabilities for change detection
 * - Development environment with proper file system permissions
